# cloud-security
The purpose of this repository is to hold Bash shell scripts, configuration files, and YAML playbooks relevant to setting up a vulnerable network model than can be monitored using the ELK Stack within Azure Cloud Web Server. Services used include Ansible &amp; Docker for implementation of application &amp; network security. Due to the use of containers within this environment, this model can easily be scaled with Docker.



To find the *Automated ELK Stack Deployment* README, please see the Ansible directory.

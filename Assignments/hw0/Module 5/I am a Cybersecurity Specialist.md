# Reflection

- **What I Want to Learn From This Class & What I'm Most Excited About Learning** (200 words)  
  - What I hope to learn from this class is a general, solid understanding of security standards, frameworks, and compliances. It is also my goal to better understand the necessary sequence of steps and certifications it would take to be a competative pentesting applicant for cybersecurity jobs. Although I'm already familiar with scripting in Bash, C and Python, I would like to grow beyond what is commonly referenced as a "script kiddie", and practice secure coding practices when doing so. In particular, I would also like to learn management of different versions of Python and different implementations of C through requirements files. Another topic I am interested is the decompositon of data or software through Ghidra. While I am extremely familiar with a few distributions of Linux, I also want to have good understanding of CLI tools used for penetration testing. Most importantly, I would like to develop a process of mitigating and dealing with a security breach or crisis of some kind. I am most excited about learning how to assess risks, document/analyze them, and then find solutions for vulnerabilities. Lastly, I would like to continue learning how to efficiently automate as much as possible with regards to security and remote access.
- **How the Skills I Will Learn Will Help Me Through My Career** (100 words)
  - It is my expectation that the skills I learn in this program will be skills that can be continually improved and practiced. While I do not expect that this program will immediately help me get a new job, I do expect that the experience will establish a foundation for a career in cybersecurity and pentesting. My goal is to practice and use the skills and knowledge gained from this course to gain several certifications before applying to potential jobs. I feel that with my experience as Network Administrator, my background in Pure Mathematics, and what I hope to gain from this course together with the aforementioned certifications, I will be prepared for cybersecurity analyst job interviews.
